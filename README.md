#The currently unnamed theme by Bunnies McGee#0972 and Maxie#2116
This is a work in progress theme designed with transparency in mind  

Demo Video: https://a.fluntcaps.me/arwqiz.webm (isnt updated, looking into)

##Download
- Main theme: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maxie01/we-made-a-theme/master/BunniesMcGee.theme.css
- Maxie Patch: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maxie01/we-made-a-theme/master/Maxie-Patch.theme.css
- Image Plugin: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maxie01/we-made-a-theme/master/Bunny.plugin.js

## How to set up

1. Place both css files into theme folder
2. Place plugin in plugin folder
3. Enable Both css and plugins
4. Profit

###In order to have a single image follow these steps
1. If not already, disable the plugin (and restart discord to remove the "Prev" and "Next" buttons)
2. Go to the BetterDiscord settings menu, and open the custom css tab
3. Paste this code in
```
.app {
    background-image: url(https://somewebsite.com/yourfile.png);
}
```

Please note that due to restrictions in the https protocol (Do not ask about a fix for this as there is none), any image you use must be on a secure server, what this means is the url must start with https, one useful way to do this is by using an image hosting site such as [fluntcaps](https://fluntcaps.me) or [pomf.cat](https://pomf.cat/)

Lastly, Save your changes and the image should be set

###Tutorial for custom image rotation coming soonâ„¢
It's either going to be annoying af to set up, or easy, but I think it's going to be the former

Lots of love
