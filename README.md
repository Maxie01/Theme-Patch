This is a work in progress theme with an addition of transparency.

`Updated: 1/17/2017`

###In order to have a custom image
Please change the url in .body like this.
```
body {
    -webkit-transition: background 3s ease-in-out;
    transition: background 3s ease-in-out;
    background: #fff url(https url here);
    background-size: 1920px auto;
}
```
If you don't have an 1080p image, you could just always add this instead right under the import line:
```

.app {
	background-size: cover;
    background-image: url(https url here);
}
```

Please note that due to restrictions in the https protocol, any image you use must be on a secure server, what this means is the url must start with https, one useful way to do this is by using an image hosting site such as [imgur](https://imgur.com), [fluntcaps](https://fluntcaps.me) or [pomf.cat](https://pomf.cat/)

Lastly, Save your changes and the image should be set

```
Lots of love
Maxie and Bunnies McGee <3
