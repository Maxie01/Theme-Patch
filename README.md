###In order to have a custom image
Please change the url in .body like this.
```
body {
    -webkit-transition: background 3s ease-in-out;
    transition: background 3s ease-in-out;
    background: #fff url("https url here");
    background-size: 1920px auto;
}
```

Please note that due to restrictions in the https protocol, any image you use must be on a secure server, what this means is the url must start with https, one useful way to do this is by using an image hosting site such as [imgur](https://imgur.com), [fluntcaps](https://fluntcaps.me) or [pomf.cat](https://pomf.cat/)

Lastly, Save your changes and the image should be set

```
Lots of love
