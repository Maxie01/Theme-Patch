###In order to have a single image follow these steps
Simply just add the url in the box provided.

Please note that due to restrictions in the https protocol (Do not ask about a fix for this as there is none), any image you use must be on a secure server, what this means is the url must start with https, one useful way to do this is by using an image hosting site such as [imgur](https://imgur.com), [fluntcaps](https://fluntcaps.me) or [pomf.cat](https://pomf.cat/)

Lastly, Save your changes and the image should be set

Lots of love
