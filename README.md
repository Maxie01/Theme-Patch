3. Profit!

###In order to have a custom image
Please change the url in .app like this.
```
.app {
    background-image: url(http or https here);
    background-size: cover;
    background-color: #8F99A8;
    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);
}
```

Please note that due to restrictions in the https protocol (Do not ask about a fix for this as there is none), any image you use must be on a secure server, what this means is the url must start with https, one useful way to do this is by using an image hosting site such as [imgur](https://imgur.com), [fluntcaps](https://fluntcaps.me) or [pomf.cat](https://pomf.cat/)

Lastly, Save your changes and the image should be set

```
Lots of love
